# StoreRatings - FullStack Web Application (React Frontend & Node Backend)

Welcome to StoreRatings! This web application allows users to discover, rate, and review stores. It features a role-based access system with distinct functionalities for System Administrators, Normal Users, and Store Owners.

This README focuses on the **ReactJS frontend** and **Express.js backend** of the application. It assumes you have a compatible backend API already developed and running.

## Overview

StoreRatings provides a platform for:

- **Normal Users:** To sign up, browse registered stores, search for stores, and submit/modify ratings (1-5) for them.
- **Store Owners:** To view ratings and statistics specific to their registered store.
- **System Administrators:** To manage the entire platform, including users, stores, and view overall platform statistics.

The application uses a single login system, and user access to functionalities is determined by their assigned role.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **ReactJS** – JavaScript library for building UI
- **Redux Toolkit** – Efficient and predictable state management
- **React Router DOM** – Client-side routing and navigation
- **TailwindCSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling
- **Axios** – For making HTTP requests to backend API
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Language used for frontend logic

### Backend

- **Express.js** – Web framework for Node.js used to build APIs
- **PostgreSQL** – Relational database used to store structured data
- **Sequelize ORM** – Used to define models, relationships, and query PostgreSQL
- **JWT Authentication** – Secures endpoints using token-based auth
- **bcryptjs** – Password hashing before storing in database
- **dotenv** – Loads environment variables from `.env`
- **CORS** – Allows secure API access across different origins
- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime for executing backend logic

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- npm v9+
- PostgreSQL installed and running
- Backend server must be available at a defined API base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5000/api`)
